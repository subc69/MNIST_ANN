# MNIST_ANN
This project is for mnist digit classification (learning purpose).
The ANN model is implemented at basic level. The forward and back propagation are implemented by writing the chain rule for differentiation using numpy.
All calculations including forward and back prop are implemented in complete object oriented manner.
Sigmoid function is used for activation in each layer.
The data used for training and testing are mnist image files (.jpg) derived from Kaggle dataset.
Data processing classes are implemented for first deriving the csv data from image files for training and testing and then retriving data for training and testing through data generators implemented using python, pandas, numpy..
Then pandas dataframe is used for reading and writing data.
Further work is in progress....
